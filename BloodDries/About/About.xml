&lt;size=24&gt;About&lt;/size&gt;
Blood that has splattered on the ground now steadily darkens as it dries up over a few days (if the temperature is above 0). It also gradually fades as it erodes.

I made this mod because I was getting frustrated by there being dessicated corpses surrounded by fresh blood dotted around the map (particularly when playing in a warm biome without much rain).

This is my first coding mod, so very open to feedback and suggestions.

&lt;size=24&gt;Compatibility&lt;/size&gt;
It doesn't break with "Blood Stains" (although you'll see dried blood footprints).  It also works with "Brighter Blood" - I'd just recommend putting this mod after it in the load order, because it needed patching.
