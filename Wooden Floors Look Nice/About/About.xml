Not sure about you, but I find wooden flooring looks the nicest, both in the game and in real life.  
Wooden floors are also debuffed enough due to their flammability.

This mod patches the beauty of the standard wooden flooring to be 2 (instead of 0).

Does not require a new save game, and can be safely enabled and disabled without impact.
