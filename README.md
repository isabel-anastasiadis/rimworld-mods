# rimworld-mods

This is a repository to track all the rimworld mods I make.

I've initialised the repo in the `Steam/steamapps/common/RimWorld/Mods` folder, so I don't need a separate repo for each mod, and so the git files aren't in the mod folder.


## Reminder of how to publish updates

1. Copy the updated mod folder into the `Mods` folder of the current game install
2. Run the game
3. Enable the mod (and test it)
4. When happy, the `Mods` screen should have an option to publish the update.
