&lt;size=24&gt;About&lt;/size&gt;

Blood that has splattered on the ground now steadily darkens as it dries up over a few days (if the temperature is above 0, and faster if it is hot). It also gradually fades as it approaches the point where it disappears.

I made this mod because I was getting frustrated by there being dessicated corpses surrounded by fresh blood dotted around the map (particularly when playing in a warm biome without much rain).

This is my first coding mod, so very open to feedback and suggestions.


&lt;size=24&gt;Compatibility&lt;/size&gt;

It won't break your save if you want to remove it again - you'll see an error initially, but if you save and load again it should be all fixed.

&lt;size=15&gt;Other blood related mods&lt;/size&gt;

It doesn't break with "Blood Stains" (although you'll see dried blood footprints).  I've patched it to work fine with "Brighter Blood"; this mod just needs to be loaded after it.
